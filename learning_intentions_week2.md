## Learning Intention
I am programming computers to calculate the mean, median and mode of dice rolls.
Use the following smilies to indicate how you did:

| Success Criteria                                           | How did I do |
| -------------                                              |:------------:| 
| I can create sprites and costumes.                         |              |
| I can create variables.                                    |              |
| I can create a loop (repeat).                              |              |
| I can change variables as the program runs.                |              |
| I can modify the number of rolls.                          |              |
| I can output random numbers.                               |              |
| I can use a list to store each dice roll.                  |              |
| I can use the computer to count totals of each dice roll.  |              |
| I know how to calculate the mean.                          |              |
| I know how to calculate the mode.                          |              |
| I know how to calculate the median.                        |              |
| I calculate the mean programmatically (write an algorithm).|              |
| -------------                                              |              |
| Extension                                                  |              |
| -------------                                              |              |
| I can calculate the mode programmatically.                 |              |
| I can calculate the median for 10 rolls on paper.          |              |
| I can extend the code for >6 sided or loaded dice.         |              |
| -------------                                              |              |
| Challenge                                                  |              |
| -------------                                              |              |
| I can debug any code that doesn't work.                    |              |
| I calculate the median programmatically.                   |              |
| I can use code to cheat.                                   |              |
| -------------                                              |:------------:|
