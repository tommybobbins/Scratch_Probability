| Success Criteria                                           | How did I do |
| -------------                                              |:------------:| 
| I can create sprites and costumes.                         |              |
| I can create variables.                                    |              |
| I can create a loop (repeat).                              |              |
| I can change variables as the program runs.                |              |
| I can modify the number of rolls.                          |              |
| I can output random numbers.                               |              |
| I can use a list to store each dice roll.                  |              |
| I can use the computer to count totals of each dice roll.  |              |
| I know how to calculate the mean.                          |              |
| I calculate the mean programmatically (write an algorithm).|              |
| I can calculate the mode in my head.                       |              |
| I can calculate the median in my head.                     |              |
| -------------                                              |              |

| I calculate the mode programmatically.                     |              |
| I calculate the median programmatically.                   |              |
| I can extend the code to change the mean.                  |              |
| -------------                                              |              |
